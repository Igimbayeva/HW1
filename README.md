# HW1
The purpose of this project is refactoring the existing code for the client to ensure the code is concise, descriptive and easy to read.
Additionally, refractoring must be done not to interfere with the functionality of the web page.
In an essence, we are cleaning up the code by using specific criteria provided by the client to increase its accessibility, efficiency and legibility and improve user experience.
